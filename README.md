AssetDiagnosis
==============

Platform application to diagnose a corrupted asset table

Based on work by me, Julio Pontes and others.

This will work only on platform 11.4 which means CMS 2.5.x. If you want to use it on an 
earlier version you must at minimum change JApplicationWeb to JWeb and possibly make other changes.

Place this file in the Joomla root and then navigate to it.

It will run some simple tests. They won't find all issues but they will fine the most common ones we have 
seen in the wild.
